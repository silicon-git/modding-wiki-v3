[DRV3-Sharp](https://github.com/CaptainSwag101/DRV3-Sharp) is the main multipurpose tool used to extract and modify Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony's files. The most recent release can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/CaptainSwag101/DRV3-Sharp/releases/tag/2024-09-03).

DRV3-Sharp is capable of the following:
- Unpacking [.CPKs](File%20Formats#.CPK)
- Unpacking/repacking [.SPCs](File%20Formats#.SPC)
- Extracting textures and models from [.SRDs, .SRDIs, and .SRDVs](File%20Formats#.SRD)
- Unpacking/repacking [.STXs](File%20Formats#.STX)
- Unpacking/repacking [.WRDs](File%20Formats#.WRD) from .SPCs
- Pairing .WRD-containing .SPCs with their matching .STX-containing counterparts, and unpacking/repacking them in tandem

This means it can help you with:
- Changing the contents of most of DRV3's file archives
- Viewing images and 3D model files
- Changing the game's text
- Changing the game's scripting
